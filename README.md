# Analysis of Japanese Loanwords
A LING1340 Spring 2020 Project by Lindsey Rojtas: This will be an analysis of gairaigo (foreign words, in Japanese) originating from the English Language written in Katakana 

## General Info
- Name: Lindsey Rojtas
- Project Title: "Analysis of Japanese Loanwords"
- Summary: This project will work with a Japanese corpus and filter out any words comprised of entirely Katakana, which is the Japanese alphabet used for non-Japanese words. There will likely be general analyses of length in katakana characters, as well as some other data points that I haven't determined yet (as of 2/5/2020).
