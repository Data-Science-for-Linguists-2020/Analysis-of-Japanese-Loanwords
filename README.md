# Analysis of Japanese Loanwords
A LING1340 Spring 2020 Project by Lindsey Rojtas: This will be an analysis of gairaigo (foreign words, in Japanese) originating from the English Language written in Katakana 

## General Info
- Name: Lindsey Rojtas
- Project Title: "Analysis of Japanese Loanwords"
- Summary: This project will analyze the use of Katakana words (many of which are gairaigo) among different age groups, as well as some general analysis of these Katakana words with regards to length and frequency. There is also a possibility (as of 3/18/2020) that certain machine learning algorithms will be used to predict the age group of a participant based on the amount of Katakana words used if a correlation between the two is found.
